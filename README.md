* Single binary with wide architecture support: Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi
  (ARM)
* Go and 3rd party language plugin support
* Is as slow as it's slowest car, won't slow down linearily the more car
  you use.
* Latest Go version support for developers
* Triggering system to show only relevant information
* Almost everything can be overwritten through environment variables
* UTF-8 support out of the box (thanks to Go)
* 256 colour support, with special effects where the terminal software
  has support for them

Core cars:

- Time
- Date
- Current directory
- Exit code of last command
- User and hostname
- Background jobs

If you want add some new feature, or fix some bug, open a ticket!

## Requirements

In order to use the theme, you will first need:

* A very cool font:

  * [Nerd fonts](https://nerdfonts.com/)
    ([Arch Linux AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nerd-fonts-complete/))
     <-- our default
  * Alternatively a Powerline compatible font like
    [Vim Powerline patched fonts](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts),
    [Input Mono](http://input.fontbureau.com/) or
    [Monoid](http://larsenwork.com/monoid/).
  * On Ubuntu like systems you'll need the `ttf-ancient-fonts` package
    to correctly display some unicode symbols that are not covered by
    the Powerline fonts above.
    ([Arch Linux AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ttf-ancient-fonts/))

* Make sure terminal is using 256-colors mode with `export
  TERM="xterm-256color"`
* For [iTerm 2](http://iterm2.com/) users, make sure you go into your
  settings and set both the regular font and the non-ascii font to
  powerline compatible [fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) or
  the prompt separators and special characters will not display
  correctly.

## Compatible terminal emulators


- Linux

  - [Tilix](https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web/)
  - [Terminator](https://gnometerminator.blogspot.ie/p/introduction.html)
  - [Konsole](https://konsole.kde.org/)

- Mac

  - [iTerm2](http://iterm2.com/)

## Installing

1, We have prepared release executables on our release page

https://github.com/bullettrain-sh/bullettrain-go-core/releases.

Download the one that matches your architecture and OS.

Of course you are more then welcomed to build your own, customised
version if you feel comfortable with Go.
[Here are some help to do that](docs/creating-new-cars.md).

2, In your rc files you only need to set the single prompt variable.

(Single quotes are important not to store the evaluated result in the
variable, but to reevaluate on every call.)

**ZSH - .zshrc**

`PROMPT='$(bullettrain $?)'`

## Options

Most of the behaviours can be configured through environment variables,
making you free from the recompiling work.

These are the **core** feature configuration variables and module
configuration information can be found on their respective READMEs.

All envirnment variables must be exported for Go to be able to pick up.

E.g.: `export BULLETTRAIN_CAR_ORDER="time user host python ruby"`

### Defining colours and text effects

Form of the colourization string:
`foregroundColor+attributes:backgroundColor+attributes`

Colors

- black
- red
- green
- yellow
- blue
- magenta
- cyan
- white
- [0...255 (256 colors)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors)

![ansi256](readme_assets/ansi256.png)

**NOTE**: support for some attributes varies across terminal emulator
softwares.

Foreground Attributes

- B = Blink
- b = bold
- I = italic
- h = high intensity (bright)
- i = inverse
- s = strikethrough
- u = underline

Background Attributes

- h = high intensity (bright)

### Defining car templates

Car templates gives the user the most flexibility to rearrange/decorate
the car's content further. With the template's help the user can also
control which element of the car she wants to hide (although the
processing of it is still done, so she gains no speed). The template
language is using Go's standard library `text/template` package.

Here is an example which will introduce the concepts and usage:

The Time car could expose it's icon and printed text (time).

There are a few rules to follow:

* exposed names start with a dot, because they will internally be
  bundled within a Go struct
* exposed names start with capital letter, because the struct needs to
  expose them and everything is exposed (aka public) in Go if it is
  capitalised
* cars should define colouring functions that it should expose, with
  suggested naming:
  * `cs`: function to colour the symbol
  * `ci`: function to colour the information the car exposes
  * `c`: function to colour the car's base colouring
* exposed names are enclosed in `{{` and `}}` as they are the Go
  template system's chosen delimiters
* template environment variables
  have the suffix of `_TEMPLATE`

Colour function names are suggestion and can vary in number and naming
in plugins.

`{{.Icon}}` : the icon of the car
`{{.Time}}` : the information this car exposes

Then one could surround the car's output text with spaces to her liking
and define it in the env var:

`export BULLETTRAIN_CAR_TIME_TEMPLATE="{{.Icon | printf " %s " | cs
}}{{.Time | c}}"`

`printf` is mapped to `fmt.Printf` and is perfect for adding spaces and
other chars around the symbol, while in the second step of the pipeline
is the colouring. This makes it easy not to leave the spaces without colours.

### Last command exit code Car

Showing last command's exit code.

Since the bullettrain executable is running as a separate process as the
shell which is executing it, it needs to get the last command's exit
code by an argument.

Shells have a special global for it: `$?`

ZSH example:

`PROMPT='$(bullettrain $?)'`

**Callword**: `status`

* `.Icon`: the car's icon
* `.Code`: the error code text

### Background jobs Car

https://github.com/bullettrain-sh/bullettrain-go-core/issues/24

## Development

### Managing dependencies

We use `go dep` as it is now production ready.

https://github.com/golang/dep

### Plugins

We support [native Go cars](docs/creating-new-cars.md) compiled right
into the prompt builder, or ones
[written in other languages](docs/creating-plugin-car.md) . Plugins
written in other languages will still benefit (to a degree) from Go's
parallel execution.

### Benchmarking

We not only want the prompt to be super sexy but also super snappy.
What'd be the point writting it in Go?! :)

So to bluntly benchmark it's speed, build the executable and then sample
a 10x batch 5 times like this in ZSH:

```
$ go build bullettrain.go
$ repeat 5 (time (repeat 10 ./bullettrain > /dev/null))
( repeat 10; do; ./bullettrain > /dev/null; done; )  0.48s user 0.16s system 107% cpu 0.590 total
( repeat 10; do; ./bullettrain > /dev/null; done; )  0.48s user 0.14s system 107% cpu 0.581 total
( repeat 10; do; ./bullettrain > /dev/null; done; )  0.51s user 0.15s system 107% cpu 0.615 total
( repeat 10; do; ./bullettrain > /dev/null; done; )  0.49s user 0.17s system 107% cpu 0.613 total
( repeat 10; do; ./bullettrain > /dev/null; done; )  0.51s user 0.17s system 107% cpu 0.625 total
```

Be sure to benchmark your code to make sure you are not introducing a
feature that will make the prompt sluggish all of a sudden.

## FAQ

**Q: Why don't we use BULLETTRAIN_CARS to disable the unwanted cars?**

**A:** As Go is statically linked and every car you need, needs to be
compiled into the single executable, setting a single env var won't
change the size of it, though will change the speed of execution
somewhat. The main reason is that people like to see a variable doing a
single job and doing it well. Therefore you are capable of not loading
the cars by the `BULLETTRAIN_CARS` variable, but the `_SHOW` suffixed
ones are really tasked doing just that.
